Criterias fullfilling in the Shift Planner : 

1. people with Experience 0 should always be given shift G
2. every person should be allocated only one shift either G, 1, 2 or 3.
3. for shift 1 we require only 1 person, for both shift 2 and 3 we require 2 person
4. for shift 1, Band with data Associates should only be there with alternating Domain data with AD-SEL and FD-SEL  (for example if you gave first AD-SEL then next time it should be FD-SEL) and also if for Domain you have taken FD-SEL with Sub_Domain Transmission then next time when you give FD-SEL it should Sub_Domain Hydraulics 
5. for shift 2, Band with data Layam should only be taken , there should be 2 person in this one from Domain AD-SEL and other from FD-SEL and also it first time you take FD-SEL Domain and Transmission Sub_Domain then next time it should give Hydraulics Sub_Domain
6. for shift 3, both Band with data Associate and Layam should be used, there should be 2 person one from Associate and other form Layam if you have taken AD-SEL Domain for associate then next time it should FD-SEL Domain with every time alternating between Transmission and Hydraulics Sub_Domain same all this with the Layam Band
7. only FD-SEL has Sub_domain they are Hydraulics and Transmission 
8. the result should be shown in tabular method
9. rest people left will be automatically given G shift
10. There should be a minimum 5 week gap when the same person is alotted the shift (1, 2 or 3) again
11. If there are 2 person in shifts then their both experience can be like (3,1) or (2,2) mostly
12. Almost every person with same year of experience should have almost same number of total shifts at the end of 21 week shift
